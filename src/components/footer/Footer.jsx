      <p>
        Thank you for visiting the site. This project is based upon/ is an
        inspiration from <mark>Jonnala Praneeth Reddy Sir's</mark>{" "}
        <strong>Wall of Portfolios</strong> project. I just wanted to create
        something similar since long time but for budding developers & freshers.
        Wall of portfolio project was a catalyst to that idea. Earlier I was
        looking at curated.portfolios and cofolios. These are also good projects
        in the same niche. I would suggest you to check them out before you
        curate next awesome portfolio.,next one is curated companies stay tuned.
      </p>

      <p>Best Regards</p>
